# Getting Started with App
 
 I used postgres and Hasura to connect DB with UI and heroku for deployment.

## Available Features

Here we are providing 2 different interfaces for Customer and Restaurant owner with the help of type field.

Customer can see active restaurant dishes , order and can cancel.

Restaurant owner can update status and can add dishes.
